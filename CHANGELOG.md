## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

**Middleware Configuration:**
```bash
# Old: Middlewares in Traefik labels with @docker suffix
# New: Middlewares in file provider with @file suffix

# No action needed - already deployed
```

**RedisInsight Migration:**
```bash
# Redis Commander is replaced by RedisInsight
# Old data is preserved in Redis

docker stop aquatiq-redis-commander
docker rm aquatiq-redis-commander
docker compose up -d redis-insight
```

**Certificate Fix:**
```bash
# If you have custom origin certificates, ensure proper formatting
# No extra line breaks after BEGIN/END markers
```
